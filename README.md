An odd selection of modified stock parts that've made their way into a mod.

Specs!

LV-N "Nerv" mass increased to 3.0125.

LV-N "Nerv" now has an Alternator that produces 0.3125 units of EC per second.

All Pods now have an emergency fuel cell. Please note that this cell is 67% as efficient as the radially mounted fuel cell.

All Liquid Fuel consuming engines (Lqf+Ox, LV-N, Jets, R.A.P.I.E.R.) now have a small, 2.5 unit battery added to them.

The Mark 1-2 Command Pod, hopefully, should show back up. Fingers crossed.

The old Reliant is now the Raptor Reliant and has buffed specs.

The old Swivel is now the Swiveling Raptor has has buffed specs.
