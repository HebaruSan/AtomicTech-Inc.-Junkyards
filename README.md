An odd selection of modified stock parts that've made their way into a mod.

LV-N "Nerv" mass is now decreased to 2.65.

LV-N "Nerv"'s thrust is increased by about 16.67%.

LV-N "Nerv" now has an Alternator that produces 0.3125 units of EC per second.

All Pods now have an emergency fuel cell. Please note that this cell is 67% as efficient as the radially mounted fuel cell.

All Engines, stock only I think, now have a small, 2.5 unit battery added to them.

The Mark 1-2 Command Pod, hopefully, should show back up. Fingers crossed.

The old Reliant is now the Raptor Reliant and has an overhauled performance.

The old Swivel is now the Swiveling Raptor and has an overhauled performance.

Redid the description and other minor stats for the Experimental Storage Unit.

The stock LES now has a slightly higher thrust.

The HG-5's stats have been tweaked to bring it closer to the CM-16.
