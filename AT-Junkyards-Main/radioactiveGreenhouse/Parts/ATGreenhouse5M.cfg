	description = The 5 Meter Fry Archivist Greenhouse is a rigid greenhouse for growning fresh food. Opening the shutters allows the greenhouse to use sunlight in addition to the onboard lighting and reduce EC use. The insane size and weight of this module makes it neary impractical to launch it into orbit. SimpleConstrution or Extraplanetary Launch Pads is recommended to send this into orbit.
