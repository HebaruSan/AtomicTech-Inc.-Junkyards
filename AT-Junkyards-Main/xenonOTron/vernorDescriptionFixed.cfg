  @title = VR-N1ER Veer-Governor "Vernor" Engine
  @description = The VR-N1ER Veer-Governor, or "Vernor" Engine is an attitude control thruster. These motors are linked to RCS controls, but are powered by a Fuel + Oxidizer mix, making them significantly more powerful than Monopropellant-powered RCS thrusters. They're fairly more bulky in comparison though, and feature only one nozzle facing outwards, although most all Kerbals agree this's an acceptable trade-off for the additional punch they pack.
