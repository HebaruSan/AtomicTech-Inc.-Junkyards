  @manufacturer = AtomicTech Inc.
  @description = A student in AtomicTech's Great Ideas with Science and Technology Summer Camp suggested that they use the technology behind ISPE's Dawn and combine it with a jet engine. This young kerbal, despite being in a freshman in high school, was hired on the spot and appointed head of the Dusk Program within the hour. The Dusk allows you to fly in the upper atmosphere of oxygenated planets and moons, only requiring the a bit less electric charge than the Dawn.
