Hello! I'm James Ervin!

I understand that you're probably reading this because I've addressed it specifically to you. I've moved to the BSD-3 License from the MIT License. You'll still be able to use my code just do the following:

1.) Keep my LICENSE file in your code.
2.) Add this .txt file into your code.
Note for 1&2: You don't have to make it show up while your program is running, just leave it in where it can be easily found.
3.) Mention me in your credits!
4.) Don't use my code in illegal or legally ambiguous situations.

Do all that and it's yours to use!
