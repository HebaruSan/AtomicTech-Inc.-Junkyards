  @description = Despite the big scary trefoil painted onto the side of this engine, its radioactive exhaust, and tendency to overheat, the LV-N Atomic Rocket Motor is harmless, mostly. Note that the LV-N is the only LV series engine to run solely on Liquid Fuel - the future is glowing bright, now with an Alternator and better ASL efficiency!
